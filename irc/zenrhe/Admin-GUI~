So i need an admin GUI to edit the following stuffs.

			
			KEYSERVER ONLY


		kerberos configuration

	/etc/krb5.conf	*PUBLIC*
This file contains the realm definition. If you're not using DNS to
point clients at the keyservers, this needs pushed to all clients.


	/etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl	*SENSTIVE*
This file describes who is allowed to use the admin server. Usually 
it is */admin so we'll punch you out two principals.

	/etc/krb5kdc/kdc.conf	*SENSITIVE*
This file defines the behaviour of the keyservers, including what 
encryption types they offer, and logging options.


		key database initialisation

	krb5_newrealm
IGNORE THE MESSAGE. You don't ever need the main DB password again. 
The risk is not that you lose it, but that someone else gets it.
	
	keyserver escape
Now the master password is generated we generate two principals 
user@DOMAIN and user/admin@DOMAIN.

Further tasks can be done off the keyserver, and it should be 
considered "best practise" to do so.

	kadmin policies

Policy: host
Maximum password life: 120 days 00:00:00
Minimum password life: 0 days 00:00:00
Minimum password length: 64
Minimum number of password character classes: 4
Number of old keys kept: 1
Maximum password failures before lockout: 3
Password failure count reset interval: 0 days 00:00:00
Password lockout duration: 0 days 00:00:00

Policy: n00b
Maximum password life: 0 days 00:00:00
Minimum password life: 0 days 00:00:00
Minimum password length: 8
Minimum number of password character classes: 2
Number of old keys kept: 5
Maximum password failures before lockout: 3
Password failure count reset interval: 1 day 00:00:00
Password lockout duration: 0 days 00:01:00

Policy: n00b_herder
Maximum password life: 0 days 00:00:00
Minimum password life: 0 days 00:00:00
Minimum password length: 8
Minimum number of password character classes: 3
Number of old keys kept: 5
Maximum password failures before lockout: 3
Password failure count reset interval: 1 day 00:00:00
Password lockout duration: 0 days 01:00:00

So, these are your basic default policies. One for machine 
passwords, one for regular people, and one for administrative 
tasks. Someone with complex needs would love a simple GUI 
with input validation and copying.

These are the 'host' policy principals in the current, 
basic database.

host/brain.tortuga.piratepress.org@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
kadmin/admin@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
kadmin/brain.tortuga.piratepress.org@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
kadmin/changepw@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
kiprop/brain.tortuga.piratepress.org@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
krbtgt/TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG
ldap/brain.tortuga.piratepress.org@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG

Most of the time I'm active on my 'n00b' policy account.
smollet@TORTUGA.PIRATEPRESS.ORG

My 'n00b_herder' policy account allows kerberos db edits
including arbitrary password resets, as well as granting
write access to the LDAP server.
