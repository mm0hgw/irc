	Client side simple csv "editor"
	
	Specification:
	
Must run client-side, no laggy bullshit.
The user is expected to provide a .csv for editing.
The user is then expected to identify columns from a display of the first ~10-15 rows of a local .csv
The user is then expected to identify any, or no, header and footer rows of the selected columns.
The selected data is then organised as a ballot matrix as described in the ballot package manual, and uploaded to server-side.
