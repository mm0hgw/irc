for each function, the dox need to say:
	what it does, 
	what parameters it takes, 
	what it returns, and 
	what errors it can throw.
	
	What it does.
	what parameters it takes, 
	what it returns,
This is done, but not verified, in the dox. Should be restricted to what, not why or how.

 what errors it can throw.
not done. error codes are generated by combnGen/R/combnGen.R functions valid_nk() valid_index() and valid_combinations(). What / why / how are all dox fodder.
